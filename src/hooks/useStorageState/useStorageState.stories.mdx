# useStorageState hook
The `useStorageState` hook has 4 primary components to it:
 - The caching context,
 - The hooks,
 - The transformers, and
 - The generators

## Caching Context
In order to speed up read times for individual state values, and
to ensure that a write to this state elsewhere will necessitate
a re-render to that state in all components, a context is provided.

To use this context, and opt-in to the caching & state consistency,
you simply need to add the context provider to the top level of your
app.

## Hooks
There are 2 hooks provided in this module, the namesake `useStorageState`
hook, in addition to the `useReadOnlyStorageState`. The first hook
acts like a classic `useState`, whereas the read only version
only gives you a variable to read from. 

## Transformers
Since local storage only supports string variables, for
non-string data types a transformer is needed.

Provided by default are transformers for JSON serializable
types, as well as dedicated transformers for numbers (int & float).

Custom transformers can also be provided in case JSON is not enough!
To implement a custom transformer, you'll need a `type` to `string`
and a `string` to `type` conversion. 

Example with typing for using a custom transformer.
```typescript
    type MyTypeToString: (val: MyType) => string;
    type StringToMyType: (val: string) => MyType;

    let myTypeToString: MyTypeToString;
    let stringToMyType: StringToMyType;

    const [myObject, setMyObject] = useStorageState<MyType>(minMicKey, minMicDefaultVolume, myTypeToString, stringToMyType);
```

## Generators
Because of the transformers & additional data, the individual hooks
created for a specific piece of data have a lot of boilerplate.

To remedy this, some default hook generators have been provided. The
generator hooks take the same data which a regular hook would take,
but generate a named read/write & readonly hook. An example usage
of this looks like:
```typescript
export const [useMinMicVolume, useReadOnlyMinMicVolume] = generateIntStorageStateHooks('min-mic', -40);

// Equivalent to
import {
    numberToStringTransformer,
    stringToIntTransformer,
} from './transformers';

const minMicKey = 'min-mic';
const minMicDefaultVolume = -40;

export const useMinMicVolume = useStorageState<number>(minMicKey, minMicDefaultVolume, numberToStringTransformer, stringToIntTransformer);
export const useReadOnlyMinMicVolume = useReadOnlyStorageState<number>(minMicKey, minMicDefaultVolume, stringToIntTransformer);
```

# Examples
Using the example from above, we can generate a counter
whos value is stored in local storage. 

Try refreshing the page after incrementing the counter!
